### Usage: 

This theme can be used when you want a splash of fun for your website. Inspired by a fun day at the beach this theme is sure to bring a lot of fun to your website. 

### Customization:

Customizing this team is easy with our many colour options! Simply look for what colours you want and find the class associated with it. Want the ocean colour for your background colour? Well add .bg-ocean to what ever element you are wanting it to go to. And the same for the other colours. We also have pre made font sizes and weights for your convenience. 

Can’t decide how you want to style a component? We made that easy for you as well. Automatically the components will be plain for easy customization but if you’re out of ideas then simply use the pre-made ones. They will all have a consistent theme to each other. Although our unordered list option does automatically add the “fun” version.  But there is another “fun” version to choose from! 

### Component Customization Names:
.button-fun
.form-fun
.table-striped
.ul-fun

 There are also many spacing, padding, margin, border and more options to choose from. 

**We hope you enjoy using our theme!**
